# Block_Cyclic_Reduction
A lighweigth module to solve block tridiagonal systems using block cyclic reduction

This is a vrey light weight module to provide a very succint (and not very optimized) implementation of block cyclic reduction. In this case we solve a elongated sparse sysmtem using the approach.
